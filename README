eZ Mollom README

NOTICE
-------------------
This extension is based Mollom's REST API, which was suppose to replace the XML-RPC API in 
2011. However, the Mollom REST API is still in beta. Therefore we recommend not to use the 
eZ Mollom on production sites until further notice. If you wish to be notified when the 
eZ Mollom extension is available for production sites, please send a mail to info@fumaggo.com. 
In the mean time we will continue development on the eZ Mollom extension.


What is eZ Publish?
-------------------
eZ Publish is a professional PHP application framework with advanced CMS
(content management system) functionality. As a CMS it's most notable feature
is its revolutionary, fully customizable and extendable content model. This is
also what makes it suitable as a platform for general PHP development, allowing
you to develop professional Internet applications fast.

Standard CMS functionality, like news publishing, e-commerce and forums is
already implemented and ready for you to use. Its stand-alone libraries can be
used for cross-platform, database independent PHP projects.

eZ Publish is database, platform and browser independent. Because it is
browser based it can be used and updated from anywhere as long as you have
access to the Internet.


What is Mollom?
-------------------
When a user posts a comment or other content to your website, your web server sends 
this content to Mollom for evaluation. Mollom tells your site whether it thinks the 
content is spam and gives it a quality score. By monitoring content activity on all 
sites in the Mollom network, Mollom is in a unique position to determine if a post is 
potentially spam; not only based on the posted content, but also on the past activity 
and reputation of the poster. 

Mollom is actively developed and maintained by Dries Buytaert, the founder and project 
lead of Drupal, and Benjamin Schrauwen. Mollom is currently used by more than 30,000 sites, 
including Sony, Adobe, LinuxJournal, Warner Bros Records, Netlog, NBC, and others. 
As of September, 2010, Mollom currently protects over 30,000 websites with an average 
efficiency rate of 99.93% - which means that only 7 in 10,000 spam messages are not 
routinely caught by Mollom's filters.
